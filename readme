# OpenCV Build From Source (CMake + Qt Integration)

This repository contains a custom build of OpenCV compiled from source using CMake,
integrated with a Qt-based C++ application on Windows 10.

### Key Technical Aspects
- Built OpenCV (3.x/4.x) fully from source using **CMake**
- Configured build flags, modules, and dependencies manually
- Integrated OpenCV with **Qt** (C++), handling include paths and linker settings
- Used both Release/Debug configurations
- Verified with real-time image processing modules

### Purpose
This project demonstrates experience with software compilation, dependency
configuration, and build management using **CMake** — skills relevant to
packaging, continuous integration, and HPC environments.
